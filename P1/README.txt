This README is made for the first assigment of the Machine Learning Class.
There are two ipynb files. Please run cars.ipynb for the first upload,
cleaning, training, optimization and training of the first dataset. Please run
water.ipynb for the same reason for the second dataset. The files will
automatically upload the databases as well.

The below link has two folders P1 and Datasets. P1 contains the two ipynb
files and the Datasets contains the car and water folders which themselves
have the data.
