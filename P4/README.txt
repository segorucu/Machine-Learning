This project implements value iteration, policy iterations and Q-Learning on
a 4*4 frozen lake problem and a 600-states forest problem.

mdptoolbox, openai gym, hiive mdptoolbox are used.

The necessary codes are following:
1. example.py: This code is imported by the other two to convert a P, R matrix
from gym format to mdptoolbox format.
2. Frozen Lake.ipynb: It generates the plots for frozen lake.
3. forest.ipynb: It generates the plots for forest.

The codes can be found at:
